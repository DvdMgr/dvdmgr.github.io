## About me ##

I'm a PhD student in Telecommunications Engineering at the Department of
Information Engineering (DEI) at the University of Padova.

### Now ###

As of now, I'm working with the [ns-3](http://www.nsnam.org) network simulator
to assess and improve the performance of currently available IoT technologies,
with a particular focus on Low Power Wide Area Networks and, more specifically,
LoRaWAN.
